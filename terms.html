        Version 12062013 <br>
        Pay Anywhere User Agreement <br>
        <p>
        This Pay Anywhere User Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“you”, “your”) and Pay          Anywhere (“PA”) governing your use of PA’s payment processing services and card reader (together, the “Services”).          1. Relationship: PA is what is called a “Payment Service Provider” or “Payment Facilitator”. As such, PA, and          not you, will serve as the merchant of record with MasterCard International, Inc., Visa International, Discover          Network, PayPal, American Express and other networks or associations (the “Card Associations”) with regard to          purchases (each, a “Transaction”) by your customers in which credit or debit cards bearing the service mark of VISA,          MasterCard, Discover Network, PayPal, American Express or another specified network or association (each, a          “Card”) are presented for payment. PA is not a bank, it does not offer banking services as defined by the United States          Department of the Treasury, and it is not in the business of providing money transmission or other money service          business services as defined by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. PA serves as your agent in completing          Transactions with your customers. In furtherance of this relationship, you authorize PA (i) to submit Transactions to,          and receive settlement from, the Card Associations and the applicable payment processors and bank sponsors through          which PA processes your Transactions (collectively, “PA Providers”), (ii) to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your          behalf, and (iii) to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each Transaction that you authorize.          Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until your PA Account is closed or terminated.      </p>
                    <p> 2. Payment Transactions/Acceptance of Cards: You have been given a unique PA Account (the “PA Account”)          through which your Transactions will be recorded by PA. Your PA Account will permit you to accept and submit          Transactions on a compatible mobile device. Your use of the Services will be subject to, and you agree to be bound          by, all of the rules and requirements of the PA Providers, as applicable to your activities under this Agreement. A          summary of these requirements can be found at http://images.payanywhere.com/pdf/cag_generic_12032013.pdf (the          “Provider Terms and Conditions”). Since the Provider Terms and Conditions may change from time to time, it is          important that you review them with regularity. By continuing to use your PA Account, you agree to accept and abide          by such changes.      </p>  
                     
   <p>Without limitation, you agree to abide by the following Provider Terms and Conditions: </p>
       <ul>
       <li>a. You will accept all Cards in accordance with the Provider Terms and Conditions. </li>
       <li>b. You will only submit valid and completed Transactions produced as a direct result of bona fide sales of goods  or services made to a customer by you, and such Transactions will accurately describe the goods or services sold or delivered. All such Transactions shall be free of any liens, claims, and encumbrances other than ordinary sales    taxes. You will not use the Services for any fraudulent or illegal undertaking. No Transaction will represent a sale to any principal, partner, proprietor, or owner of you, if you are an entity. </li>
       <li>c. You will maintain a fair policy for the exchange, refund and return of goods sold and the adjustment of services rendered. You will post that policy at or before the Transaction occurs and in accordance with the Provider Terms and Conditions, and such policy must comply with the Provider Terms and Conditions. You will not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a Transaction, unless required by law, and not accept cash 
        or any other item of value for preparing a Transaction refund. </li>
       <li> d. You will not bill or collect from any customer for any purchase or payment on a Card unless a chargeback has been exercised, you have fully paid for that chargeback, and you otherwise have the right to do so. </li>
       <li> e. You will ensure compliance with rules adopted by any Card Associations relating to the privacy and security  of cardholder and card transaction data, including without limitation the Payment Application Data Security  Standard (“PA DSS”) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), as they may be  amended from time to time;</li>
       
       <li> f. You will maintain fraud and chargebacks below thresholds set by the Card Associations; </li>
       <li> g. You will accept, without discrimination, all valid Cards properly presented by customers for payment for  goods or services. With respect to VISA and MasterCard products, you may elect to accept credit cards or debit/prepaid cards or both, as reflected on the merchant application you completed with PA (the “PA  Application”), and you must display appropriate signage to display the same. You agree to pay for any additional  fees incurred as a result of your subsequent acceptance of Transactions with any VISA or MasterCard product that you have elected not to accept. </li>
      <li>  h. You may establish a minimum Transaction size for accepting Cards so long as such amount does not exceed  $10, or such other amount established by law, and such minimum Transaction size requirement does not  discriminate between Card issuers or between Card Associations. You may not impose a maximum Transaction size on Transactions, or add a fee to a Transaction. </li>
       <li> i. You may offer discounts or in-kind incentives for payment by the use of cash, checks or Cards, provided that he terms of the discount or in-kind incentives do not differentiate on the basis of the Card issuer or Card Association.</li>
      <li>  j. You will not accept a Card as payment (other than for a preauthorized mail order, telephone order, or other   sale), if the customer seeking to use the Card does not present the Card to permit you to examine it and obtain an 
        imprint or otherwise use the physical Card to complete the transaction.</li>
       <li> k. You will comply with all requirements and restrictions regarding the display of Card Association marks. 
        Any inconsistency between the Provider Terms and Conditions and this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of the 
        Provider Terms and Conditions. You may use the Services only to the extent that you obey all laws, rules, and 
        regulations applicable to your use of the Services. You may only use the Services in the fifty states of the United 
        States of America and the District of Columbia. You may not act as a payment intermediary, aggregator or service
        bureau or otherwise resell the Services on behalf of any third party. This means that you may not use the Services to 
        handle, process or transmit funds for any third party. You also may not use the Services to process cash advances. PA          reserves the right to reject any Transaction that you submit for settlement. </li>
        </ul>
                <p>     3. PA Fees: You agree to pay the applicable fees listed on the PA Application (“Fees”) whenever you use the  Services. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, PA reserves the right to change Fees. If PA changes its Fees, it will give you thirty (30) days’ notice of any change. You will not be permitted to continue to use the Services unless you consent to the change in Fees. To withdraw your consent, you will need to close your PA Account. </p>
       <p>
        4. Next Day Funding: PA will deposit to your PA Account the amounts actually received by PA for Transactions          submitted through PA (less any applicable Fees). Once your bank account information is verified, PA will          automatically deposit your money in your designated bank account. A deposit to your bank account in connection          with a Transaction will normally occur one (1) business day after the completion of that Transaction. However,          Transactions may not be deemed complete in PA’s discretion until PA has received or sent the funds and/or when PA          or the designated financial institutions have accepted the Transaction or funds. PA may, in its discretion, provisionally          credit amounts to your PA Account, subject to receipt of final payment by PA in respect of a Transaction.                 
        <p>  5. Suspension/Reserve/Recovery/Pooling of Funds: PA may temporarily suspend or delay payments to you or          withhold or reserve your funds in order to secure your performance of your obligations to PA. This action may arise          for any reason, including the occurrence or suspected occurrence of Transaction chargebacks or refunds, for which          you are responsible. A chargeback will occur if the Transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason, (c) was          not authorized or PA has any reason to believe that the Transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful,          suspicious, or in violation of this Agreement. The amounts suspended, delayed or reserved shall be initially          determined, and may be increased or decreased, in PA’s reasonable discretion as necessary to cover potential financial  exposure on the part of PA. You grant PA a security interest in and lien on any and all funds held in any such reserve,          and also authorize PA to make any withdrawals or debits from such reserve, without prior notice to you, to collect          amounts that you owe PA. This security interest survives for as long as PA holds your funds in reserve.</p>                <p>   PA may recover, recoup, set off or deduct the amount of any chargeback and any associated Fees, fines, or penalties          listed in the PA Application or assessed by the PA Providers from your PA Account (including without limitation any          reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with PA. In furtherance          of this right, you authorize PA to debit your bank and/or to initiate reversal or adjustment entries with respect to your          bank account. If PA is unable to recover funds for which you are liable, you will pay PA the outstanding amount          immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and          other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of PA in connection with the collection of all such amounts, along with          interest on the unpaid amount calculated at the highest legal rate.   </p><p>       You understand that your funds may be commingled and held with other PA merchant funds in one or more pooled          accounts at one or more FDIC-insured banks by PA for the benefit of you and other PA merchants (each a “Pooled          Account”). PA has sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any Pooled Account. You will not          receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that PA handles for you. As consideration for using the services          provided by PA, you irrevocably assign to PA all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that          may accrue or are attributable to its holding of your funds in a Pooled Account or reserve.   </p><p>       6. Transaction Errors. You are responsible for monitoring your Transactions and ensuring that PA’s payments          to you are correct. You must notify PA of any errors in payments made to you within sixty (60) days of the error first          appearing on your electronic transaction history. Failure to notify PA of such an error will be deemed a waiver of any          right to amounts owed to you.      </p><p>             7. Information: You authorize PA to disclose all Transaction data and other information about you as required          by the PA Providers, and their affiliates, agents, subcontractors and employees, in order to process your Transactions.          You also authorize each of the foregoing parties to use such information to perform their responsibilities in connection          with the programs offered by them and for such other purposes as they may reasonably deem necessary, including          such purposes as are described in the Provider Terms and Conditions. PA may request additional information and          documentation from you at any time. PA may also ask for permission to inspect your business location. You agree to          advise PA immediately of any change in the ownership or nature of your business, or in your or your business’          financial condition or location, or in your approved monthly Transaction volume and average ticket. You authorize          PA, at any time during which this Agreement remains in effect, to make any credit inquiries of you or your business,          including but not limited to requesting reports from third party credit reporting bureaus.     </p><p>              8. Conversion to Direct Merchant: You acknowledge that you will be converted from being a merchant of PA          to a direct card acceptance relationship with the applicable Card Association or PA Provider, as applicable, under the          following circumstances: </p>
        <ul><li>
        a. With regard to American Express, if and when you become what American Express calls a “High CV          Merchant”. Upon such conversion, (i) you will be bound by American Express’ then-current card acceptance          agreement, (ii) American Express will set the discount and other fees payable by you for its Card acceptance, and          (iii) you will have the option of continuing to use PA to provide Services to you subject to the terms and conditions          contained in the Provider Terms and Conditions. A High CV Merchant is one that has greater than $1,000,000 in          charge volume in a rolling 12 month period, or greater than $100,000 in charge volume in any three consecutive          months.   </li><li>  b. With regard to Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and/or PayPal if and when you exceed $100,000 in charge          volume for the applicable Card brand in a rolling 12 month period. Upon such conversion, and in the event that        you wish to continue to accept and submit Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and PayPal Transactions, you will be          bound by the then current card acceptance agreement of the applicable PA Provider, at discount and other fees to          be determined at the time.      </li></ul></p><p>             9. Representations and Warranties: You confirm that: (i) you are at least 18 years of age; (ii) you are either a          legal resident of the United States, a United States citizen, or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the          state in which it operates; (iii) you are eligible to register for and use the Services; (iv) the name identified by you          when registering for the Services is your legal name or business name under which you sell goods and services; (v)          all information contained in your completed PA Application is true and correct in all respects; and (vi) this Agreement          is your valid and binding obligation, and does not violate any provisions of law, or conflict with any other obligations          to which you are subject.   </p>  <p>              10. No Assignment: You may not assign or transfer to any third party this Agreement or any payments due to          you in connection with your Transactions.</p>                <p>   11. Third Party Rights: You hereby authorize the PA Providers, and their affiliates, agents, subcontractors and          employees, to enforce the terms of this Agreement as against you, without establishing any obligation on their part to          do so. You also authorize the PA Providers to use your name, address, and website address in any media from time to          time.            </p><p>       12. PA Provider Agreements: PA is a party to certain other agreements with the PA Providers. You acknowledge          that you are not a beneficiary under any of those agreements. You also agree to abide by all limitations of liability          contained in those agreements with respect to such PA Providers.    </p>
        <p>
        13. Wireless Carriers: Mobile devices used in connection with the Services may not be modified contrary to the          manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including but not limited to disabling hardware or software controls.          You acknowledge that the use of a modified device to use the Services is expressly prohibited. PA does not warrant          that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or third party carrier. Your use of the Services may be          subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer and your carrier.          </p><p>         14.

PA’s Privacy Policy includes          important information on what information PA and the PA Providers collect about you, how each uses that          information, and with whom each shares that information. Also, to ensure the quality of the Services and for          other lawful purposes, PA may monitor or record calls between PA and you (for example, your conversations          with PA’s customer service or sales departments). PA’s privacy policy may change from time to time, so          please review PA’s Privacy Policy with regularity. </p>
        <p>15. Disclosures and Notices: You confirm that you have become a party to, and become bound by, this 
          Agreement by completing the PA Application and accepting it electronically over the Internet or through your wireless 
          carrier. This is done by clicking or entering “I Agree” where requested on an electronic version of the PA Application. 
          By providing this consent, you acknowledge that you have received and reviewed all applicable pages, terms and 
          conditions of this Agreement, including the Provider Terms and Conditions. 
 </p>
        <p> 16. Termination: PA or you may terminate this Agreement for any or no reason, and at any time. In order to 
          terminate this Agreement, you must close your PA Account, at which time all pending Transactions will be cancelled. 
          This Agreement will immediately and automatically terminate to the extent any PA Provider deregisters PA. Any 
          funds held by PA for you at the time of closure or termination, less any applicable Fees, will be paid out to you, subject 
          to PA’s rights to suspend, delay or reserve funds. All provisions of this Agreement necessary to accomplish or enforce 
          this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement. </p>
        <p> 17. PA Ownership/License: You agree that the “Pay Anywhere” name and mark, and the Services (and any 
          suggestions, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information provided by you or any other 
          party relating to the Services), are owned by PA, that PA owns the title, copyright and all other worldwide intellectual 
          property rights associated with the Services, and that PA reserves all rights not expressly licensed to you in this 
          Agreement. PA grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license, without the right to

          in the Services, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Services, except to the extent that such 
          restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (vi) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the 
          proper working of the Services, prevent access to or use of the Services by PA’s other users, or impose an unreasonable

          </p>
        <p> 18. Indemnification: You will indemnify, defend, and hold PA and the PA Providers harmless from and against 
          any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, tax assessments, penalties, fines, interest, and expenses 
          (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim, action, audit, investigation, inquiry,

          security code. </p>
        <p> 19. No Warranties: THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. 
          USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
          APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER 
          EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
          MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE 
          OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM PA OR THROUGH THE 
          SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING 
          THE FOREGOING, PA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; 
          THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, 
          UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE 
          SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ANY CONTENT 
          DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS DOWNLOADED 
          AT YOUR OWN RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR 
          PROPERTY OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH DOWNLOAD. </p>
        <p> 20. Limitation of Liability: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO 
          EVENT SHALL PA OR THE PA PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, 
          INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE
          OF, INABILITY TO USE, OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL 
          PA OR THE PA PROVIDERS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM 
          HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR PA 
          ACCOUNT, OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. IN NO EVENT SHALL PA OR THE PA 
          PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, 
          DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT OF FEES EARNED BY PA 
          IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD 
          IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR LIABILITY. </p>
        <p> 21. Governing Law: This Agreement and any dispute relating to it will be governed by Michigan law as applied 
          to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Michigan, without regard to its choice of law or 
          conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction. </p>
        <p> 22. Disputes: PA and you each agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the 
          Services (each, a “Dispute”), shall be settled by following the procedures: </p>
        <p> a. The party initiating the Dispute shall contact the other party and provide a written description of the Dispute, 
          all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution (the “Claim Notice”). You agree to contact PA 
          by calling or writing to: Claims Administrator, 250 Stephenson Hwy, Troy Michigan 48083, Tel. No. 1-855-733-
          7264. </p>
        <p> b. The Claims Administrator for PA and you shall then seek in good faith to resolve the Dispute. As part of this 
          process, each party to the Dispute shall provide a monetary amount that, if paid to the party initiating the Dispute, 
          would settle the Dispute (the “Settlement Amount”). If the parties do not agree to a Settlement Amount, or the 
          parties are otherwise unable to settle the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of the Claim 
          Notice, then the parties shall proceed to arbitration, as set forth below. </p>
        <p> c. IN THE ABSENCE OF RESOLVING THE DISPUTE, AND INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, PA AND 
          YOU AGREE TO SETTLE AND RESOLVE FULLY AND FINALLY ALL DISPUTES EXCLUSIVELY BY 
          ARBITRATION, EXCEPT IN THE FOLLOWING LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES: (I) PA OR YOU MAY 
          COMMENCE AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE THE AMOUNT OF THE 
          DISPUTE DOES NOT EXCEED THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT OF SUCH COURT; AND (II) YOU MAY 
          FILE A DISPUTE WITH ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY THAT CAN, 
          IF THE LAW SO AUTHORIZES, SEEK RELIEF AGAINST PA. THE AGREEMENT TO HAVE DISPUTES 
          RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION IS MADE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH PARTY IS 
          IRREVOCABLY, KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVING AND RELEASING ITS RIGHT TO 
          LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE DISPUTES.</p>
        <p> d. The foregoing arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in 
          accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect when a Claim Notice is duly provided under this 
          Section 22. If any AAA procedure or rule conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement <br>
          apply. </p>
        <p> e. The arbitration set forth in this Agreement and any proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the Federal 
          Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator may be entered as a judgment 
          in any court having jurisdiction. Any arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, subject only to those 
          exceptions under the FAA. The award of the arbitrator shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. PA and you 
          agree the FAA’s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. </p>
        <p><br>
          f. Unless PA and you agree otherwise, the foregoing arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator 
          selected by utilizing the process provided in the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect when Claim 
          Notice is duly filed. The arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney and/or retired judge. Except as otherwise provided 
          below, the arbitration shall be conducted in the county where the principal address of the party against whom the 
          Dispute is initially commenced is located – and for any claim against PA, that address shall be the address of the 
          Claims Administrator. The federal or state law that applies to this Agreement will apply during the arbitration. </p>
        <p> g. For Disputes of $10,000.00 or less that are initiated by you (“Small Disputes”), the following rules shall
          apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the procedures or rules of the AAA and/or in this Agreement: 
          (1) the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA’s Expedited Procedures; (2) the arbitrator shall 
          include a finding as to whether the initiation of such Dispute was frivolous and, if it is determined by the arbitrator 
          not to be frivolous, then PA shall pay the fees and costs assessed by the AAA in administering the arbitration; (3) 
          If the arbitrator finds that PA is liable to you for an amount greater than the Settlement Amount presented by PA 
          prior to the commencement of arbitration (after all offsets and counterclaims are applied), then PA shall be 
          required to pay in addition to any award of the arbitrator an amount equal to the greater of (x) $1,000.00, or (y) 
          twice the amount of your reasonable attorneys’ fees; (4) you may choose to conduct the arbitration in the state of 
          your principal address. </p>
        <p> h. PA AND YOU EACH AGREES NOT TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. 
          ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A

        <p>Version:03072014 </p>
        <p> Pay Anywhere User Agreement</p>
        <p> This Pay Anywhere User Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“you”, “your”) and Pay 
          Anywhere (“PA”) governing your use of PA’s payment processing services and card reader (together, the “Services”). 
          1. Relationship: PA is what is called a “Payment Service Provider” or “Payment Facilitator”. As such, PA, and 
          not you, will serve as the merchant of record with MasterCard International, Inc., Visa International, Discover 
          Network, Pay Pal, American Express and other networks or associations (the “Card Associations”) with regard to 
          purchases (each, a “Transaction”) by your customers in which credit or debit cards bearing the service mark of VISA, 
          MasterCard, Discover Network, Pay Pal, American Express or another specified network or association (each, a 
          “Card”) are presented for payment. PA is not a bank, it does not offer banking services as defined by the United States 
          Department of the Treasury, and it is not in the business of providing money transmission or other money service 
          business services as defined by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. PA serves as your agent in completing 
          Transactions with your customers. In furtherance of this relationship, you authorize PA (i) to submit Transactions to, 
          and receive settlement from, the Card Associations and the applicable payment processors and bank sponsors through 
          which PA processes your Transactions (collectively, “PA Providers”), (ii) to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your 
          behalf, and (iii) to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each Transaction that you authorize. 
          Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until your PA Account is closed or terminated. </p>
        <p> 2. Payment Transactions/Acceptance of Cards: You have been given a unique PA Account (the “PA Account”) 
          through which your Transactions will be recorded by PA. Your PA Account will permit you to accept and submit 
          Transactions on a compatible mobile device. Your use of the Services will be subject to, and you agree to be bound 
          by, all of the rules and requirements of the PA Providers, as applicable to your activities under this Agreement. A 
          summary of these requirements can be found at http://images.gonab.com/pdf/cag_nab_12032013.pdf (the “Provider 
          Terms and Conditions”). Since the Provider Terms and Conditions may change from time to time, it is important that 
          you review them with regularity. By continuing to use your PA Account, you agree to accept and abide by such 
          changes. </p>
        <p> Without limitation, you agree to abide by the following Provider Terms and Conditions: </p>
        <p> a. You will accept all Cards in accordance with the Provider Terms and Conditions. </p>
        <p> b. You will only submit valid and completed Transactions produced as a direct result of bona fide sales of goods 
          or services made to a customer by you, and such Transactions will accurately describe the goods or services sold 
          or delivered. All such Transactions shall be free of any liens, claims, and encumbrances other than ordinary sales 
          taxes. You will not use the Services for any fraudulent or illegal undertaking. No Transaction will represent a sale 
          to any principal, partner, proprietor, or owner of you, if you are an entity. </p>
        <p> c. You will maintain a fair policy for the exchange, refund and return of goods sold and the adjustment of 
          services rendered. You will post that policy at or before the Transaction occurs and in accordance with the 
          Provider Terms and Conditions, and such policy must comply with the Provider Terms and Conditions. You will 
          not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a Transaction, unless required by law, and not accept cash 
          or any other item of value for preparing a Transaction refund. </p>
        <p> d. You will not bill or collect from any customer for any purchase or payment on a Card unless a chargeback 
          has been exercised, you have fully paid for that chargeback, and you otherwise have the right to do so.</p>
        <p> e. You will ensure compliance with rules adopted by any Card Associations relating to the privacy and security 
          of cardholder and card transaction data, including without limitation the Payment Application Data Security 
          Standard (“PA DSS”) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), as they may be 
          amended from time to time; </p>
        <p> f. You will maintain fraud and chargebacks below thresholds set by the Card Associations; </p>
        <p> g. You will accept, without discrimination, all valid Cards properly presented by customers for payment for 
          goods or services. With respect to VISA and MasterCard products, you may elect to accept credit cards or 
          debit/prepaid cards or both, as reflected on the merchant application you completed with PA (the “PA 
          Application”), and you must display appropriate signage to display the same. You agree to pay for any additional 
          fees incurred as a result of your subsequent acceptance of Transactions with any VISA or MasterCard product 
          that you have elected not to accept. </p>
        <p> h. You may establish a minimum Transaction size for accepting Cards so long as such amount does not exceed 
          $10, or such other amount established by law, and such minimum Transaction size requirement does not 
          discriminate between Card issuers or between Card Associations. You may not impose a maximum Transaction 
          size on Transactions, or add a fee to a Transaction. </p>
        <p> i. You may offer discounts or in-kind incentives for payment by the use of cash, checks or Cards, provided that 
          the terms of the discount or in-kind incentives do not differentiate on the basis of the Card issuer or Card 
          Association. </p>
        <p> j. You will not accept a Card as payment (other than for a preauthorized mail order, telephone order, or other 
          sale), if the customer seeking to use the Card does not present the Card to permit you to examine it and obtain an 
          imprint or otherwise use the physical Card to complete the transaction. </p>
        <p> k. You will comply with all requirements and restrictions regarding the display of Card Association marks. 
          Any inconsistency between the Provider Terms and Conditions and this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of the 
          Provider Terms and Conditions. You may use the Services only to the extent that you obey all laws, rules, and 
          regulations applicable to your use of the Services. You may only use the Services in the fifty states of the United 
          States of America and the District of Columbia. You may not act as a payment intermediary, aggregator or service 
          bureau or otherwise resell the Services on behalf of any third party. This means that you may not use the Services to 
          handle, process or transmit funds for any third party. You also may not use the Services to process cash advances. PA 
          reserves the right to reject any Transaction that you submit for settlement.</p>
        <p> 3. PA Fees: You agree to pay the applicable fees listed on the PA Application (“Fees”) whenever you use the 
          Services. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, PA reserves the right to change Fees. If PA changes its Fees, it will 
          give you notice describing any such change, and the changes will become binding on you when you use the Services 
          after the effective date of such change as stated in the notice. You will not be permitted to continue to use the Services 
          unless you consent to the change in Fees. To withdraw your consent, you will need to close your PA Account. </p>
        <p> 4. Next Day Funding: PA will deposit to your PA Account the amounts actually received by PA for Transactions 
          submitted through PA (less any applicable Fees). Once your bank account information is verified, PA will 
          automatically deposit your money in your designated bank account. A deposit to your bank account in connection 
          with a Transaction will normally occur one (1) business day after the completion of that Transaction. However, 
          Transactions may not be deemed complete in PA’s discretion until PA has received or sent the funds and/or when PA 
          or the designated financial institutions have accepted the Transaction or funds. PA may, in its discretion, provisionally 
          credit amounts to your PA Account, subject to receipt of final payment by PA in respect of a Transaction. </p>
        <p> 5. Suspension/Reserve/Recovery/Pooling of Funds: PA may temporarily suspend or delay payments to you or 
          withhold or reserve your funds in order to secure your performance of your obligations to PA. This action may arise 
          for any reason, including the occurrence or suspected occurrence of Transaction chargebacks or refunds, for which 
          you are responsible. A chargeback will occur if the Transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason, (c) was 
          not authorized or PA has any reason to believe that the Transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful, 
          suspicious, or in violation of this Agreement. The amounts suspended, delayed or reserved shall be initially           determined, and may be increased or decreased, in PA’s reasonable discretion as necessary to cover potential financial 
          exposure on the part of PA. You grant PA a security interest in and lien on any and all funds held in any such reserve, 
          and also authorize PA to make any withdrawals or debits from such reserve, without prior notice to you, to collect 
          amounts that you owe PA. This security interest survives for as long as PA holds your funds in reserve. </p>
        <p> PA may recover, recoup, set off or deduct the amount of any chargeback and any associated Fees, fines, or penalties 
          listed in the PA Application or assessed by the PA Providers from your PA Account (including without limitation any 
          reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with PA. In furtherance 
          of this right, you authorize PA to debit your bank and/or to initiate reversal or adjustment entries with respect to your 
          bank account. If PA is unable to recover funds for which you are liable, you will pay PA the outstanding amount 
          immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and
          other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of PA in connection with the collection of all such amounts, along with 
          interest on the unpaid amount calculated at the highest legal rate. 
          You understand that your funds may be commingled and held with other PA merchant funds in one or more pooled 
          accounts at one or more FDIC-insured banks by PA for the benefit of you and other PA merchants (each a “Pooled 
          Account”). PA has sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any Pooled Account. You will not 
          receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that PA handles for you. As consideration for using the services 
          provided by PA, you irrevocably assign to PA all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that 
          may accrue or are attributable to its holding of your funds in a Pooled Account or reserve. 
          6. Transaction Errors. You are responsible for monitoring your Transactions and ensuring that PA’s payments 
          to you are correct. You must notify PA of any errors in payments made to you within sixty (60) days of the error first 
          appearing on your electronic transaction history. Failure to notify PA of such an error will be deemed a waiver of any 
          right to amounts owed to you. </p>
        <p> 7. Information: You authorize PA to disclose all Transaction data and other information about you as required 
          by the PA Providers, and their affiliates, agents, subcontractors and employees, in order to process your Transactions. 
          You also authorize each of the foregoing parties to use such information to perform their responsibilities in connection 
          with the programs offered by them and for such other purposes as they may reasonably deem necessary, including 
          such purposes as are described in the Provider Terms and Conditions. PA may request additional information and 
          documentation from you at any time. PA may also ask for permission to inspect your business location. You agree to 
          advise PA immediately of any change in the ownership or nature of your business, or in your or your business’ 
          financial condition or location, or in your approved monthly Transaction volume and average ticket. You authorize 
          PA, at any time during which this Agreement remains in effect, to make any credit inquiries of you or your business, 
          including but not limited to requesting reports from third party credit reporting bureaus. </p>
        <p> <br>
          8. Conversion to Direct Merchant: You acknowledge that you will be converted from being a merchant of PA 
          to a direct card acceptance relationship with the applicable Card Association or PA Provider, as applicable, under the 
          following circumstances: </p>
        <p> a. With regard to American Express, if and when you become what American Express calls a “High CV 
          Merchant”. Upon such conversion, (i) you will be bound by American Express’ then-current card acceptance 
          agreement, (ii) American Express will set the discount and other fees payable by you for its Card acceptance, and 
          (iii) you will have the option of continuing to use PA to provide Services to you subject to the terms and conditions 
          contained in the Provider Terms and Conditions. A High CV Merchant is one that has greater than $1,000,000 in 
          charge volume in a rolling 12 month period, or greater than $100,000 in charge volume in any three consecutive 
          months. </p>
        <p> b. With regard to Visa, MasterCard, Discover and/or Pay Pal, if and when you exceed $100,000 in charge
          volume for the applicable Card brand in a rolling 12 month period. Upon such conversion, and in the event that 
          you wish to continue to accept and submit Visa, MasterCard, Discover and Pay Pal Transactions, you will be 
          bound by the then current card acceptance agreement of the applicable PA Provider, at discount and other fees to 
          be determined at the time. </p>
        <p> 9. Representations and Warranties: You confirm that: (i) you are at least 18 years of age; (ii) you are either a
          legal resident of the United States, a United States citizen, or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the 
          state in which it operates; (iii) you are eligible to register for and use the Services; (iv) the name identified by you 
          when registering for the Services is your legal name or business name under which you sell goods and services; (v) 
          all information contained in your completed PA Application is true and correct in all respects; and (vi) this Agreement 
          is your valid and binding obligation, and does not violate any provisions of law, or conflict with any other obligations 
          to which you are subject. </p>
        <p> 10. No Assignment: You may not assign or transfer to any third party this Agreement or any payments due to 
          you in connection with your Transactions. </p>
        <p> 11. Third Party Rights: You hereby authorize the PA Providers, and their affiliates, agents, subcontractors and 
          employees, to enforce the terms of this Agreement as against you, without establishing any obligation on their part to 
          do so. You also authorize the PA Providers to use your name, address, and website address in any media from time to 
          time. </p>
        <p> 12. PA Provider Agreements: PA is a party to certain other agreements with the PA Providers. You acknowledge 
          that you are not a beneficiary under any of those agreements. You also agree to abide by all limitations of liability 
          contained in those agreements with respect to such PA Providers. </p>
        <p> 13. Wireless Carriers: Mobile devices used in connection with the Services may not be modified contrary to the 
          manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including but not limited to disabling hardware or software controls. 
          You acknowledge that the use of a modified device to use the Services is expressly prohibited. PA does not warrant 
          that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or third party carrier. Your use of the Services may be 
          subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer and your carrier. </p>
        <p> 14. Privacy: Your privacy is very important to PA. You confirm that you have read, understood and accepted 
          PA’s Privacy Policy, available at http://www.payanywhere.com/privacy. PA’s Privacy Policy includes 
          important information on what information PA and the PA Providers collect about you, how each uses that 
          information, and with whom each shares that information. Also, to ensure the quality of the Services and for 
          other lawful purposes, PA may monitor or record calls between PA and you (for example, your conversations 
          with PA’s customer service or sales departments). PA’s privacy policy may change from time to time, so 
          please review PA’s Privacy Policy with regularity. </p>
        <p> 15. Disclosures and Notices: You confirm that you have become a party to, and become bound by, this 
          Agreement by completing the PA Application and accepting it electronically over the Internet or through your wireless 
          carrier. This is done by clicking or entering “I Agree” where requested on an electronic version of the PA Application. 
          By providing this consent, you acknowledge that you have received and reviewed all applicable pages, terms and 
          conditions of this Agreement, including the Provider Terms and Conditions. </p>
        <p> 16. Termination: PA or you may terminate this Agreement for any or no reason, and at any time. In order to 
          terminate this Agreement, you must close your PA Account, at which time all pending Transactions will be cancelled. 
          This Agreement will immediately and automatically terminate to the extent any PA Provider deregisters PA. Any 
          funds held by PA for you at the time of closure or termination, less any applicable Fees, will be paid out to you, subject 
          to PA’s rights to suspend, delay or reserve funds. All provisions of this Agreement necessary to accomplish or enforce 
          this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement. </p>
        <p> 17. PA Ownership/License: You agree that the “Pay Anywhere” name and mark, and the Services (and any 
          suggestions, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information provided by you or any other 
          party relating to the Services), are owned by PA, that PA owns the title, copyright and all other worldwide intellectual 
          property rights associated with the Services, and that PA reserves all rights not expressly licensed to you in this 
          Agreement. PA grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license, without the right to 
          sublicense, to electronically access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. You may not, nor may 
          you permit any third party to do any of the following: (i) access or monitor any material or information on any PA 
          system using any manual process or robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means unless expressly authorized by 
          PA; (ii) copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, republish, upload, post, transmit, 
          resell or distribute in any way material or information from PA; (iii) permit any third party to use and benefit from the 
          Services; (iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (v) work around, bypass, or circumvent any of 
          the technical limitations of the Services, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled 
          in the Services, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Services, except to the extent that such 
          restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (vi) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the 
          proper working of the Services, prevent access to or use of the Services by PA’s other users, or impose an unreasonable 
          or disproportionately large load on PA’s infrastructure; or (vii) otherwise use the Services except as expressly allowed 
          under this Agreement. You may not export the Services directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Services 
          may be subject to export restrictions imposed by US law, including US Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. 
          Chapter VII). </p>
        <p> 18. Indemnification: You will indemnify, defend, and hold PA and the PA Providers harmless from and against 
          any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, tax assessments, penalties, fines, interest, and expenses 
          (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim, action, audit, investigation, inquiry, 
          or other proceeding instituted by a person or entity that arises out of or relates to: (a) any actual or alleged breach of 
          your representations, warranties, or obligations set forth in this Agreement; (b) your wrongful or improper use of the 
          Services; (c) any transaction submitted by you through the Services; (d) your violation of any third-party right, 
          including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights or intellectual property rights; (e) your violation of 
          the Provider Terms and Conditions, PA DSS, PCI DSS, or any law, rule or regulation of the United States or any other 
          country; (f) any other party’s access and/or use of the Services with your username, password or other appropriate 
          security code. </p>
        <p>19. No Warranties: THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. 
          USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
          APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER 
          EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
          MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE 
          OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM PA OR THROUGH THE 
          SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING 
          THE FOREGOING, PA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; 
          THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, 
          UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE 
          SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ANY CONTENT 
          DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS DOWNLOADED 
          AT YOUR OWN RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR 
          PROPERTY OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH DOWNLOAD. </p>
        <p> 20. Limitation of Liability: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO 
          EVENT SHALL PA OR THE PA PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, 
          INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE 
          OF, INABILITY TO USE, OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL 
          PA OR THE PA PROVIDERS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM 
          HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR PA 
          ACCOUNT, OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. IN NO EVENT SHALL PA OR THE PA 
          PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, 
          DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT OF FEES EARNED BY PA 
          IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD 
          IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR LIABILITY. </p>
        <p> 21. Governing Law: This Agreement and any dispute relating to it will be governed by Michigan law as applied 
          to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Michigan, without regard to its choice of law or 
          conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction. </p>
        <p> 22. Disputes: PA and you each agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the 
          Services (each, a “Dispute”), shall be settled by following the procedures: </p>
        <p> a. The party initiating the Dispute shall contact the other party and provide a written description of the Dispute, 
          all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution (the “Claim Notice”). You agree to contact PA 
          by calling or writing to: Claims Administrator, 250 Stephenson Hwy, Troy Michigan 48083, Tel. No. 1-855-733-
          7264. </p>
        <p> b. The Claims Administrator for PA and you shall then seek in good faith to resolve the Dispute. As part of this 
          process, each party to the Dispute shall provide a monetary amount that, if paid to the party initiating the Dispute, 
          would settle the Dispute (the “Settlement Amount”). If the parties do not agree to a Settlement Amount, or the 
          parties are otherwise unable to settle the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of the Claim 
          Notice, then the parties shall proceed to arbitration, as set forth below. </p>
        <p> c. IN THE ABSENCE OF RESOLVING THE DISPUTE, AND INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, PA AND 
          YOU AGREE TO SETTLE AND RESOLVE FULLY AND FINALLY ALL DISPUTES EXCLUSIVELY BY 
          ARBITRATION, EXCEPT IN THE FOLLOWING LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES: (I) PA OR YOU MAY 
          COMMENCE AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE THE AMOUNT OF THE 
          DISPUTE DOES NOT EXCEED THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT OF SUCH COURT; AND (II) YOU MAY 
          FILE A DISPUTE WITH ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY THAT CAN, 
          IF THE LAW SO AUTHORIZES, SEEK RELIEF AGAINST PA. THE AGREEMENT TO HAVE DISPUTES 
          RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION IS MADE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH PARTY IS 
          IRREVOCABLY, KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVING AND RELEASING ITS RIGHT TO 
          LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE DISPUTES. </p>
        <p> d. The foregoing arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in 
          accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect when a Claim Notice is duly provided under this 
          Section 22. If any AAA procedure or rule conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement 
          apply.</p>
        <p> e. The arbitration set forth in this Agreement and any proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the Federal 
          Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator may be entered as a judgment 
          in any court having jurisdiction. Any arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, subject only to those 
          exceptions under the FAA. The award of the arbitrator shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. PA and you 
          agree the FAA’s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. </p>
        <p> f. Unless PA and you agree otherwise, the foregoing arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator 
          selected by utilizing the process provided in the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect when Claim 
          Notice is duly filed. The arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney and/or retired judge. Except as otherwise provided 
          below, the arbitration shall be conducted in the county where the principal address of the party against whom the 
          Dispute is initially commenced is located – and for any claim against PA, that address shall be the address of the 
          Claims Administrator. The federal or state law that applies to this Agreement will apply during the arbitration. </p>
        <p> g. For Disputes of $10,000.00 or less that are initiated by you (“Small Disputes”), the following rules shall 
          apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the procedures or rules of the AAA and/or in this Agreement: 
          (1) the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA’s Expedited Procedures; (2) the arbitrator shall 
          include a finding as to whether the initiation of such Dispute was frivolous and, if it is determined by the arbitrator 
          not to be frivolous, then PA shall pay the fees and costs assessed by the AAA in administering the arbitration; (3) 
          If the arbitrator finds that PA is liable to you for an amount greater than the Settlement Amount presented by PA 
          prior to the commencement of arbitration (after all offsets and counterclaims are applied), then PA shall be 
          required to pay in addition to any award of the arbitrator an amount equal to the greater of (x) $1,000.00, or (y) 
          twice the amount of your reasonable attorneys’ fees; (4) you may choose to conduct the arbitration in the state of 
          your principal address. </p>
        <p> h. PA AND YOU EACH AGREES NOT TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. 
          ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A 
          PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
          PA and you each waives the right to trial by jury of any Dispute. </p>
        <p>23.. Right to Amend: PA may change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time, and to change, delete, 
          discontinue, or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Services with notice that PA in its sole discretion 
          deems to be reasonable in the circumstances. Any use of the Services after PA’s publication of any such changes shall 
          constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as modified. </p>
        <p> 24. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the PA Application, any schedule of fees, the Provider Terms 
          and Conditions, and information contained in websites or electronic links referenced in this Agreement, expresses the 
          entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter. Reference to &quot;this Agreement&quot; also includes all 
          documents, websites and electronic links incorporated into this Agreement by reference. </p>
        <p> 25. Notices; Consent to Electronic Communications. You agree to the receipt of electronic communications by 
          email or by the posting of such information by PA at one or more of its sponsored Internet websites. In addition, all 
          notices and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement by PA to you may also be delivered by 
          FAX, overnight carrier or first class mail, postage or other charges prepaid. All notices and other communications 
          required or permitted under this Agreement by you to PA shall be delivered by you by overnight carrier or certified 
          mail, postage or other charges prepaid, addressed and transmitted as set forth below. </p>

        <h4>          PayAnywhere Terminal Agreement</h4>
        <p> This Agreement is a contract between the Merchant and PayAnywhere LLC (“PayAnywhere”). </p>
        <p> NOW THEREFORE, PayAnywhere and Merchant agree as follows: </p>
        <p> Upon the approval of Merchant’s card processing application, PayAnywhere shall ship a PayAnywhere Mobile Credit Card Terminal (the 
          “Equipment”) to Merchant. </p>
        <p> Merchant agrees (i) to use the Equipment only to process transactions permitted under its card processing agreement with Pay Anywhere, 
          (ii) to be responsible for any damage to the Equipment as a result of its misuse or negligence, and (iii) not to reverse engineer, disassemble 
          or modify the Equipment in any way. </p>
        <p> If the Equipment is defective for any reason other than Merchant’s misuse or negligence, PayAnywhere shall replace the defective 
          Equipment with comparable Equipment, which may be new or refurbished. Notwithstanding this, PayAnywhere shall have no obligation to 
          replace Equipment free of charge more than one time within any first twelve (12) month period. PayAnywhere shall have no other 
          responsibility, obligation or liability with regard to the Equipment. </p>
        <p> PayAnywhere is not the manufacturer of the Equipment. Accordingly, PayAnywhere makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and 
          disclaims any warranties as to the suitability or merchantability or fitness of the Equipment for any particular purpose, for any negligent 
          design or manufacture of the Equipment, or any software or other computer program provided with or to be used in conjunction with the 
          Equipment. In addition, PayAnywhere is not responsible for any liabilities, losses, claims, or damages of any kind in any way related to the
          use of the PayAnywhere terminals, including but not limited to any damage to the device(s) on which the Equipment is used, or to the 
          software, applications or data downloaded or maintained on such device(s). Merchant may not nor may Merchant permit any third party to 
          resell, lease or distribute in any way the PayAnywhere terminal. </p>
        <p> Merchant agrees to indemnify and hold Pay Anywhere, North American Bancard and its subsidiaries harmless from and against any and all 
          liabilities, losses, claims, damages, disputes, offsets, claims or counterclaims of any kind in any way related to the use (or misuse) of the 
          Equipment. </p>
        <p> The costs of processing transactions using the Equipment, including any data transmission and/or mobile telephone use charges, shall be 
          governed by Merchant’s card processing agreement and are not governed by this Agreement. </p>
        <p> By checking the “I have read and agreed to Card Acceptance Guide, Pricing, Terminal Agreement, and Terms &amp; Conditions”, Merchant 
          understands, consents and agrees that that this Agreement constitutes a legal contract which binds Merchant. <br>

        <p>          <strong>PayAnywhere Tablet Placement Agreement </strong></p>
        <p> This Agreement is a contract between the Merchant and PayAnywhere and its parent company North American Bancard, LLC </p>
        <p> (together, “PA”). NOW THEREFORE, PA and Merchant agree as follows: </p>
        <p> Upon the approval of Merchant’s card processing application, PA shall ship each piece of equipment described below (the “Equipment”, 
          which includes the PayAnywhere App) to Merchant. Merchant agrees (i) to use the Equipment only to process transactions permitted 
          under its card processing agreement and PA User Agreement with PA (together the “Processing Agreement”), (ii) to be responsible 
          for any damage to the Equipment as a result of its misuse or negligence, and (iii) not to reverse engineer, jailbreak, disassemble or 
          modify the Equipment in any way. Any wiping, deleting or altering in any way of the Equipment’s operating system or preset 
          configurations, including but not limited to the PayAnywhere App, shall be a material breach of this Agreement. The Equipment is to 
          be used exclusively for PA products and/or solutions. The Equipment is configured to communicate directly with PA on a regular basis, 
          and PA may contact Merchant to investigate any issues associated with the Equipment as a result of such information. Merchant is 
          expressly forbidden from using the Equipment for any other reason other than as provided above, and any use to the contrary is a 
          material breach of the this Agreement and shall automatically render this Agreement null and void. </p>
        <p> Merchant agrees that the Equipment is the property of PA, is being licensed to Merchant, and must be returned in good and working 
          condition within ten (10) days of the termination or expiration of the Processing Agreement. If the Equipment is not returned within ten 
          (10) days, Merchant agrees to pay to PA the equipment value as set forth below. Merchant authorizes PA or its agents to ACH its 
          bank account for said fees according to the Processing Agreement. In addition, Merchant agrees to be responsible for any damage 
          to the Equipment as a result of misuse or negligence. PA reserves the right to replace the Equipment with comparable models and to 
          add or discontinue models. </p>
        <p> If the Equipment is defective for any reason other than Merchant’s misuse or negligence, PA shall replace the defective 
          Equipment with comparable Equipment, which may be new or refurbished. However, Merchant shall first return the defective 
          Equipment to PA, and shall be responsible for all shipping and processing fees for the replacement Equipment. Notwithstanding 
          this, PA shall have no obligation to replace Equipment free of charge more than one time within the first twelve (12) month period. 
          PA shall have no other responsibility, obligation or liability with regard to the Equipment. </p>
        <p> PA is not the manufacturer of the Equipment. Accordingly, PA makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and disclaims any 
          warranties as to the suitability or merchantability or fitness of the Equipment for any particular purpose, for any negligent design or 
          manufacture of the Equipment, or any software or other computer program provided with or to be used in conjunction with the 
          Equipment. In addition, PA is not responsible for any liabilities, losses, claims, or damages of any kind in any way related to the use 
          of the Equipment and/or PayAnywhere Application, including but not limited to any damage to the device(s) on which the Equipment 
          is used, or to the software, applications or data downloaded or maintained on such device(s). Merchant may not nor may Merchant 
          permit any third party to resell, lease or distribute in any way the Equipment. </p>
        <p>Merchant agrees to indemnify and hold PayAnywhere LLC, North American Bancard, LLC and its subsidiaries harmless 
          from and against any and all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, disputes, offsets, claims or counterclaims of any kind in 
          any way related to the use (or misuse) of the Equipment. The costs of processing transactions using the Equipment, including 
          any data transmission charges, shall be governed by Merchant’s card processing agreement and are not governed by this Agreement. </p>
        <p> Merchant has accepted the following equipment (the “Equipment”) by checking one box below: </p>
        <p> Tablet + Stand (Value of $895.00) </p>
        <p> Tablet + Stand + Thermal Printer (Value of $1195.00) - REQUIRES PAYMENT OF $14.95 PER MONTH EQUIPMENT CHARGE </p>

          THE RIGHT BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO CHARGE MERCHANT, AND MERCHANT AGREES TO PAY A $79.00 FEE FOR EACH AND EVERY COMPLETE 
          CALENDAR MONTH THAT MERCHANT’S MONTHLY PROCESSING WITH THE EQUIPMENT DOES NOT MEET OR EXCEED THE MONTHLY TARGET 
          AMOUNT. PA WILL GIVE MERCHANT AT LEAST 30 DAYS’ NOTICE IF AND/OR WHEN MERCHANT WILL BE CHARGED THE ABOVE DESCRIBED 
          FEES. </p>

          THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARDS (“PCI DSS”) AND 
          OTHER SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS. THE PCI ANNUAL FEE WILL BE BILLED WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE PROCESSING 
          AGREEMENT. THE PAYMENT OF SUCH FEE SHALL NOT RELIEVE MERCHANT OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPLY WITH ALL RULES AND 
          REGULATIONS RELATED TO CARDHOLDER DATA SECURITY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE PCI DSS. </p>
        <p> <strong>ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT FEE(S)</strong>: IF MERCHANT ELECTS TO RECEIVE THE THERMAL PRINTER AND/OR CASH DRAWER, MERCHANT AGREES TO PAY THE MONTHLY FEE SET FORTH ABOVE NEXT TO THE APPLICABLE EQUIPMENT GROUPING. </p>

          Annual Fee and the Monthly Equipment Fee (together, the “Fees”), if any, will be charged and collected in accordance with the 
          Processing Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Processing Agreement, PA reserves the right to change the 
          Fees upon written notice. Merchant must agree to any such Fee changes to continue to use the Equipment. </p>
